<h1>FOREWORD</h1>
<P>
The Land of Look Behind hopes to be something of a
rear-view mirror, at once cocked to reveal our innermost
dimensions while transporting that, which by necessity, must
lie beyond. Involving ourselves in any interplay with flickering
images, of course, must be more than fireside watching and it is
my hope the book will be seen not solely as a collection of short
stories, although these do figure prominently in the narrative.
Satire, "beast fables," and texts (single-page entries) mingle
casually with the longer tales. Regardless of the genre, they
hope to speak as a unit--to view the conflicting colours of a
prism's radiation. Allow me to detail what you can expect.</P>
<P>
On the subject of Indian myths, these are entirely of my own
making. They are an attempt to visualize the mysteries of
creation through alien perspectives. Oral myths were Canada's
indigenous literature. In this vein, the writer resorts to utilizing
the spoken ballad form in some of his exercises. Some of the
prose pieces reflect a mirror world where the gazer chances
upon reality with a new breath of perception--much as the
native people's world was to the arrival of the whites.</P>
<P>
Bewilderment with the natural world is the keynote here.
For how many of us have wished, like the Indian, to clarify a
particularly taxing bit of life--to elucidate its function into a
more recognizable form?</P>
<P>
On a larger plane, this is the issue before the book--the
"terrible algebra of our existences,"--explored with the urgency
and sometime seriousness it deserves.</P>

<h1>TO CROSS THE BAY</h1>
<P>
"I wouldn't try a crossing in weather like this," warned the
old man. "It's a bad time of year, what with the wind and all.
Worse still, the lake water is lethal by November. That means if
you capsize it will be the chill that does you in."</P>
<P>
The old man stopped short, conscious of the look of
defiance in the youth's eyes. Young fool biting the nose to spite
his face, he thought.</P>
<P>
The marina was closed for the season, but the island's
residents made contact with the mainland one way or the
other. Until mid-winter there was a ferry service, but that
assumed a fair bit of discipline from a resident. He had to go
and come when the province obliged. Young bloods off to
escape the monotony of Wolfe Island were only marginally
willing to conform their Saturday festivities with an arbitrary
ruling. No, it was too easy to keep a boat in tow at a friend's
landing. Keep a bottle to ward off the night's chill. A bottle for
tonic against the elements and a buttress against authority.
The old man knew if he did not avail this one a boat--a safe one
at that--he would put his hands on a craft of some sort.
Accountability, he thought. They mustn't care about their own
lives. Still, there was a living to be made and it was a marina,
albeit a closed one. He would still get a boat one way or the
other, he mused again as he watched the light fade in the
evening sky. He pulled his collar sharply. Yellow leaves were
beginning to form a mat on the wooden stairs leading to the
shed. He could just make out land's end against a funnel gray
sky. Better to advise the young man of the dangers, suggest a
daytime crossing. Perhaps even try a little reverse psychology.</P>
<P>
The boy, if he could be called that, was growing impatient.</P>
<P>
"I'll be all right with a life-jacket. The boat won't be
overloaded. Just the three of us. My cousin and her kid are
going with me."</P>
<P>
The old man's eyes stirred from the damp reverie of the
previous moment.</P>
<P>
"I can't let you take a child out into that. The water's choppy
at best. You know next to nothing about handling a craft if she
takes on water or if it becomes turbulent. Why are you in such
an all-fired hurry to get across anyhow?"</P>
<P>
"Let's just say it's my business. My uncle supplies you with
business during the summer months. He has a boat in tow here
now. I'm responsible. It's still normal weather for this time of
year. Now step aside and stop your glib patronizing and
palming yourself off as an expert on the sea."</P>
<P>
"I can't stop you, son. I can only suggest, well that you await
next morning and only take two across at one time. Many a
person has received a cruel surprise out there. Why this area's
full of tales dating back to the earliest times concerning
drownings. Why from the time of the Loyalists up through my
earliest childhood--all the time in between that--my family has
run the marina and it seems someone is claimed yearly by this
lake. The French didn't call it an inland ocean for nothing.
Some even claim there's tides--real swells that will take a boat
and . . ."</P>
<P>
"The French, the Loyalists. I'm not here to listen to a
travelog. What do I care if a long list of idiots blundered to
their doom. I'm now and intend to keep on living. What should
I care about the past!"</P>
<P>
"That may very well be, son, but nobody sets out to drown.
Even on the calmest days a sudden storm whips up and . . . I
remember my daddy telling of a group of early settlers up from
the Bay of Quinte area crossing to attend a church service--full
seven of them drowned after a heavy wind whipped . . . ."</P>
<P>
"Church," snorted the other. "Well, I'm not going to any
church that's for sure." He broke into a snicker, his dark eyes
flashing above a set of stained teeth.</P>
<P>
"Yes, I guess you're not. Your type will . . . ."</P>
<P>
"My type, is it? My type is not so gutless as you, that's a fact.
A little natural obstacle doesn't send me shivering to the
nearest root cellar. This is near winter. You have to bloody well
expect a little discomfort at this time."</P>
<P>
He had unnotched the first of several ropes securing the
craft. The boat, a little three seater, sturdy, but otherwise quite
frail was bobbing up then down as each successive dark wave
hobnolled it against the current. It looked for all the world like
a large, red currant fleshy against the wind. The young man
checked the fuel, began to rev the motor before glancing
toward the distant shore. A package of cigarettes emerged
from his coat pocket. Blue gray puffs, sentinel like, climbed the
air about his person. He spat into the water and proceeded to
throw the match after it. Both whirled in the spray, then
disappeared from sight. The old man sensed his growing
uneasiness but that resilient pride checked any apparition of
modesty.</P>
<P>
"Put the fare on my uncle's account. I'll return the boat
tomorrow morning."</P>
<P>
Little lights some ten miles distant were fingering the early
darkness. Something near the water's edge bobbed cork-like in
the growing dusk. Always the worst time of day, the old man
pondered, a process of diminishing returns. Not quite dark,
sure as hell not light--an in between shudder world, a limbo of
gray.</P>
<P>
"When will the girl and her baby be along?", the old man
queried.</P>
<P>
"I'll see to that. You never mind. Go back inside, pop, where
it's warm. You'll feel better. Entering the number and registration
just about does it. I'll keep you posted," he laughed a growing laugh
that tore soft wind from his mouth. He spat again, returned to his car
and was soon out of sight.</P>
<P>
The old man looked wearily at the ground. He was recalling
more and more of that early story his dad passed down from
his dad concerning the overcrowded boat up Adolphustown
way so many years ago. If God allowed decent churchgoers to
be snuffed from sight in the act of attending His worship,
think of what must await young fools who defy His natural
laws. To be drowned outright was bad enough. To meet death
on a fool's errand with a woman and child in tow for some
vaguely evil purpose was scant courtesy to their lives. He
recalled seeing the plaque near the church outside Adolphustown
and wondering as a child why, how, they could have met death
that Sunday morning when crossing the bay in so devout a fashion.
He had never tried to anticipate God's will or ponder events anymore
than passing suggestion might receive. The little white pioneer church
near a knoll on a rising hill framed the growing memory in his mind.
A dirt road snaked up to its door with the bay clearly visible from every
pew completed the stucco walls that dotted the heavy distance.
A pretty enough place, especially in mid summer with the smell
of sweet hay in the nostrils or a full breakfast under the belt
with a pleasant drive out to smell the country air. Yes, that
little church made a lasting impression on any who might see it.
Certainly more for its serene presence than any link with that
dark episode in its past. At least this was the way he was
thinking. Yet he always wondered where the graves of those
seven drowned might be. They were pioneer graves, a mite shy
of 200 years but they must exist. A cold wind with the not too
distant splash of some object brought his thoughts back to the
present. Wonder what happens to those drowning today, he
felt himself saying almost aloud. Do they really resemble the
element they've been cast from? I mean, are their lips really
blue or did fear choke all colour from their countenances? He
thought of the baby and its mother he had not met. Wondered
if the next light he saw midway out into the channel would be
the same skiff he had registered and had at least ostensibly
given the O.K. to make the perilous crossing. Many thoughts
like these passed through his mind as he swathed a scarf more
fully around his neck.</P>
<P>
"Must be cold, so cold down into that channel," he thought
turning to the stove door on his shanty. "I'll put a few extra
logs on the fire," as he poked some tattered newspapers by the
edge of the stove. He lit his pipe and watched the smoke fade
toward horizon's line where a skiff disappeared from view.
Half absentmindedly, he thought he measured a headline
describing a craft missing since, since ... No, he mused, just my
preoccupation, he thought settling down for a quiet smoke.</p>

<h1>UPTURN THE ROCK</h1>
<p>
Upon the rocks where the baubles of broken blue glass wink
at the sun and gather strands of rusted wire with the occasional
bloodroot wildflower, a man is unbending in his efforts to
construct a stone rail fence. Specks of mica in the rock are like
lizards basking in the heat of a mid-day or a man's thumb
placed squarely about these noisome stones clattering as one
more of their number comes to rest and home.</p>
<p>
The line of cherokee rocks bends first up, then downward in
movement across the meadow much like a labouring oar listing but finally
brought into play. The glitter of turquoise water with jewels of light
on her passing wave--like wings entrances much as does this fence
moving smartly into the space of green and earth.</p>
<p>
The man, a stooped farmer, has toiled for days to clear this land
for tillage. His impact seems negligible to efforts given yet
gradually he surmises a scant return is being paid. He picks a
wildflower nudging its face through calloused stone and
watches the juice break onto forward skin. An old saying
reminds him insect bites will lessen should he smear the liquid
onto exposed limbs. He is perspiring now and the rocks shove
face-like projections into the consciousness of forest and that
periphery area, his clearing.</p>
<p>
The fence begins to melt as if in a haze and the logic of
clearing this vast expanse of earth and rock escapes him. He
thinks of each rock as the buttress of a treasure box he has just
hidden and is loath to dislodge further stones. He ponders
Christ's parable of the Kingdom of Heaven likened unto
treasure buried in a field. For reasons unclear but not
necessarily related to the blood juice, he imagines the fence to
be the one at Chancellorsville where a Union regiment died to a
man and was found by a burial brigade with apple blossoms
stuck to each bloodied face.</p>
<p>
Evasive now, he perceives the fence to be the one stopping
Pickett's charge at Gettysburg or that fence at Mons in
northern France which turned a war. He begins to rummage
through the piled stones for spent bullets and other mementoes
of a great battle. He relives the story of the Angel of Mons[1].</p>
<p>
As he dislodges more and more stones, he showers chunks of
limestone and granite backward onto the barren field. The
shower of rock is somewhat reminiscent of Ungava's meteor
spray or splintered debris forced down a soldier's foxhole.
Perhaps a runic stone will fall from tangled roots when he
burns the dead stumps of trees deciphering once and for all
why men labour or think at all. The fence swirls on and on in
growing amnesia becoming the very touchstone of all purpose,
stones from Jericho's Wall or the passkeys taken from our
material existence. Gabriel, the archangel, will sound his
trumpet here, he is assured. The dead and unburied of nameless acts
of toil and dread will stand a stone's breadth across this fence. The Face
of God will be seen in the pact nature has made with earth and stone.</p>
<p>
He turns and puts his hat by a tree, lifts a canteen and
imagines what all might be should vegetation ever be coded
and stones prophets to their accordion earth.</p>
<p>
[1] Allied soldiers at the first battle of Mons believed certain
of their numbers had escaped destruction by the intervention of
a Heavenly spectre.</p>

<h1>SEAEGGS</h1>
<p>
The reef was inviting, her languid coral nudging the breakers
as they returned from sea. From the instep of the dingy, the
fisherman in his broken English was advising the seated men of
dangers indigenous to these waters.</p>
<p>
"None of that hostile marine life business, Steve--keep it
simple--use words he's familiar with," the man with a razor lip,
Cliff, muttered to his companion. The other was busy going
through the motions in heavily accented Spanish broadly
emphasizing common words that lead to nods and ballyhoo,
those expected currencies of behavior.</p>
<p>
"I'm getting through," came the reply. "Seems beyond the
reef, dolphins and the occasional shark gather. Good fishing,
though--red snappers and groupers with anemones along the
bottom--the Mexicans eat those you know--call'em seaeggs."</p>
<p>
Cliff, only vaguely interested, beckoned Steve's attention
back to that one inescapable query--was it safe to dive.</p>
<p>
Another brief flurry of words were exchanged with the
fisherman raising a bronzed arm to touch the crown of his cap.
Some indecipherable Spanish mutterings followed and another
burst of loud exclamations before Steve halted his forays into
that basic issue of logic and pernicity. Cliff eyed the two and
then spoke again.</p>
<p>
"I don't have to catch every word of his conversation to
understand the general drift of his speech. He feels some
danger exists, so why chance it? Why soften his warning with
your doggerel translations. Your Spanish is at least good
enough to surmise what I'm instinctively feeling. Let's quit and
go ashore."</p>
<p>
"Not so fast. The water's calm here and the visibility rings
like a bell. He mentioned sharks have been sighted here not
that there's ever been an attack."</p>
<p>
"Yeah, well if there's never been a problem it's because this
spot is so isolated. Remember this area is no regular mecca for
divers of any type. Consider its remoteness and then do a little
basic thinking as to why no one has reported an aggressive
White, let alone one barracuda incident. I say it's not worth
chancing and I can tell by his face that even despite your
bundle of pesos something has been set registering."</p>
<p>
Steve feigned disinterest. Buckling his tanks, every nodule of
perspiration shone like beaded stud marks across his back. The
salt on their skins was razor sharp and the wind's jerky movement
caused incessant choppy movements about the breadth of the boat's
rhythm. A cross-section of moods was close to enveloping them. For one,
the afternoon sun was like a bayonet shoved through the thin sky.
Obtrusively red, it fumbled renewed sweat beads across each man's
brow like an eager dresser's haste with an awkward button. No sooner was
one silenced than another plodding moisture bead appeared.
Only the Mexican could remain unmoved to droplets skidding
toward the vicinity of his lower eyelid. It conjured up tales of
flies crawling into the eyes of aborigines in the Outback but
without any apparent discomfort to the owners of those eyes.
The two Americans, distracted by their sweating, cursed the
heat and the loggerheads of their situation. No flies or bobos,
as they were know here, added to their misery given their great
distance offshore. Their greater paralysis of the will lay in the
low horizon of the shore receding, then, appearing silhouetted
against blows of driven water. This, then, was the mainstay of
their indecision. All that blue--the blue of shining sky married
with further Wedgwood blue sea careening in a plaster paris
water dish, bounced up as if up from the shadows and made
renewed fear inevitable. The fisherman, quiet above all this,
seemed content to let inertia make her case. He knew heat held
a silent, unassailable logic. Sooner or later the water would call
or repel its prot√©g√©s. His task was no easier whatever their final
deliberation. A long toil with stubborn currents lay ahead,
whatever. The journey to shore was inescapable. And so he sat,
patiently content to provide that most meager of gruel--his
slight infusion of calm and warning to the strange fellows he
knew only as Touristas or more profitably, "amigo," Steve and
Cliff. His lines, staked for fish, would remain regardless and
the thin fingers of his existence remained coiled about a
routine as numbing as that the two men had pretended to escape.</p>
<p>
Now, at first furtively, then with the fury of an immense
belch only the sea could muster forth, a school of porpoises
broke about the little craft. Baleful but expression-filled eyes
of each beast broke with water, then took in as only an
intelligent creature can, the mission of the three surface beings.
Each in a return splash shimmied the dinghy making for a
resurgence of what, until now, had been a barely muted panic.
Yet most of that brief moment was consumed in expectation
and, as suddenly as it had begun, the pregnancy of the
incantation was dissolved. Slipping beneath the waves, these
most human of fish returned to nurse from the ocean's depths.</p>
<p>
"Five of them," Steve was yelling--all at least twelve feet in
length. Incredible.</p>
<p>
"See, that settles it. Porpoises are the natural enemies of
sharks. A school surrounds nursing calves and will, on
occasion, rupture an intruder by butting the offender's
abdomen. We have no more reason to fear. Any shark is long
gone."</p>
<p>
Cliff, as if moved by the last events or his friend's logic, also
appeared to have altered his position.</p>
<p>
"See, that settles it. Porpoises are the natural enemies of
sharks. A school surrounds nursing calves and will, on
occasion, rupture an intruder by butting the offender's
abdomen. We have no more reason to fear. Any shark is long
gone."</p>
<p>
It was now Steve's turn to renew the apprehension. The size
of the animals and the crash of their drift against the boat, was
sobering reality of this stretch of water's potential for the
unexpected.</p>
<p>
"Cliff, I have all the makings of a complete smart ass. All this
talk of being an experienced diver--that's all armchair politics
at this point. Sure, I've done my bit in pools and their like. But
the immensity of this place terrifies me. Just staring down
through the shades of colour, seeing the breadth of that reef,
what with all this salt and heat, is taking its toll. I've lost my
sense of the dramatic. The rapture of the deep has been
displaced by a chilling realization we don't know the state
of any conditions normally common knowledge before a dive--drop-offs,
undertows, further hostile marine life, the ...."</p>
<p>
"Hostile marine life," back to that eh, chickenshit. Hey,
where's your wings, boy? That little show whetted my appetite.
I'm all for seeing what's below. Yet I'll give you this much. I'm
sick of the confidence racket we've been pitting against
ourselves. What's more, my body fluids are near depleted. I'm
numb with heat--I can imagine myself thirsty for disaster
drinking seawater and thinking there's a spring nearby. And
that sun grows more forbidding the lower it drops. And, as you
say, I am also angered at ourselves for our naivet√©. No one can
appreciate how enervating it is just watching our skin sear and
peel displaced of its water. That's been the real experience out
here today--seeing what this world does to an outsider. I
imagine an odour growing from my arm by the moment. All I
can see is yours and his face swimming before my eyes. I don't
want to get punch drunk. I fear the prospect of going down
into whatever awaits us and struggling to re-enter a little boat
with a fisherman whose so hazed he's beyond understanding
what turmoil comprises our lot. I move we do go in, but only at
the insistence we ponder a little more firmly what the words,
"devil fish," moray and danger mean to cock and bull swaggers
like ourselves.</p>
<p>

<h1>THE HIRE</h1>
<p>
"Corn's high this year," chirped the old woman, almost with
a cackle. "All's the better for them to hide in," the old woman
was continuing, her face a brazen mixture of distain and
contempt.</p>
<p>
"These come to the house, late model cars, too, and just
wait. Lord if I knows what for," her voice trailing off, reedy,
almost water besotted much as the likeness of an old boot, the
colour of her wrinkled skin.</p>
<p>
Old Meg was an authority of sorts in these parts. Seems she
had had her share of the strange and eventful in her time.</p>
<p>
At the age of sixteen she had married. I'm speaking now of
early in this century, just as the car was making its appearance
in this part of eastern Ontario. Right away her new husband
and she had bought a farm some eight miles distance from
Kincaid off Palace Road.</p>
<p>
"Yeh, well we weren't in that house morn a week when the
strangest things began happenin'." That was the extent of her
explanation as to why she and her hubbies of a few months
made the journey into town to stay at her in-laws not once but
every night of their married life for over forty years.</p>
<p>
Meg was a recalcitrant soul. Probably had she been born
three centuries earlier folks would have said worse. Certainly
she said little and allowed you to say scarce more. Why, even
now she was staring at you, just like her custom offering only a
pittance of facts as to why there occurred an exodus of cars to
the lone side-road by the big weathered house. A cynic would
have begged the hire of something illicit to summon numbers
in that quantity. Old Meg let it be known it was something
more profound than that. Her every manner convinced you
comments as such were guilty of the grossest understatement.</p>
<p>
Weird lights, barnyard animals could be seen in the house
and a hulk of a rusted car in the debris of a lawn. She was a
widow of 18 years with no one to call her home. To listen to the
neighbours tell it, they were alarmed, best as they could
recollect, when the old Ford lumbered toward town regular as
ever each night at dusk.</p>
<p>
"What ails those two," folk along the Palace would say.
"You'd think new marrieds wouldn't care to be disturbed.
Maybe Humboldt's right when he says there's some awful
going's on there."</p>
<p>
Rumors don't substantially change, I thought. Take, for
instance, stories people tell of old Lake on the Mountain in
these parts: the underground reservoir replete with ghostly
lights, bottomless channels and of a lake not giving up its dead.
It was alarming alright to sit across that expanse of water and
see not a boat or hear a sound. Almost as eerie as standing here
looking at Meg talk of Humboldt's forecasting eclipses back in
'32. How he'd been right, dead right, each time with his
divining rod.</p>
<p>
Meg was still on the subject of Humboldt. Seems as for all
his questions he had met a bitter end. To hear Meg tell it, one
evening after the leaves were down--a cold evening at that--Humboldt,
a recluse and bachelor recently separated from a sister with whom
he had lived, was fetching wood. Being old and a careless
housekeeper, the old man tripped and split his lantern.
They found his charred remains near the door of the woodhouse
next morning. Meg had seen the flames light the November sky.
To hear her tell of it, that night had seen an uncommonly large
number of cars on the back roads off the Palace. Meg was not
drawing direct inferences, but I could see in the space between
her eyes a sly connection.</p>
<p>
She was silent on such things, drew the conversation back
then forth to peculiarities surrounding the Ashley home. Meg
was an Ashley. Since her husband's death, she had stayed in
the family home not only days but those dreaded nights as well.
I pressed for explanations.</p>
<p>
"But if you wouldn't stay a night with Charlie when he was
alive--the two of you--when you were married and had the
companionship, why would you dare now? If you made the
journey into town each night religiously for forty years only
staying here during the daylight hours, how can you bring
yourself to remain now?"</p>
<p>
The question seemed logical enough, but seemed to irritate
her. But was I trespassing too indelicately on the subject of the
late model cars or probing into a veiled past too transparently?</p>
<p>
"Yourn a relative of Conrad's,"--Jean's I heard her say. To
my surprise, I told her my aunt had often taken me by this
house on the way to Kincaid. As a child, the house in its
unkempt stage had made a lasting impression on me. Brooding,
enormously lonesome, the derelict house slouched against a
weathered fence in a loathsome fashion. Overcast skies or
darkness gave it the appearance of containing as many goblins
or trolls as fancy might see fit to inhabit, I thought of a magnificent
set of ruins, something Hawthorne might have used for his Seven
Gables or a nigh perfect setting for a decadent family in the throes
of their own poverty--some chilling Gothic charmer!</p>
<p>
What was more, the chief inhabitant of such a home seemed
straight off the grill of the gingerbread lady or the hag who
forced her fattening children to hold out fingers to see if they
were plump enough for the oven. Sufficiently chilling for a
precocious mind--the place guaranteed sleeplessness for nights
on end. Visions of the old woman, cat in hand, standing on the
deck of her flag ship-like house, ghastly in its gloom, rifled
through my consciousness. The abundance of animals and the
witchy control she exerted over them, simply reinforced the
spell over an impressionable child. Every detail was complete,
right down to that proverbial one decayed tooth dangling from
the centre of her facial cavity. One could only expect her to
jabber in cackles instead of sentences for her memory to be
entrenched deeper in every aspect.</p>
<p>
More startled now than taken back, I summoned my organizational
abilities to make sense of what she had imparted to me.
</p>
<p>
"Jean ever tell you of Direxa?"</p>
<p>
The name jolted me. I summoned forth the pieces in a
haphazard way. An old woman who traveled miles from Hay
Bay into town to sell her produce sped across my mind.
Consistent to the end, she sauntered through drudgery and
routine until they claimed her sanity.</p>
<p>
"Must be the climate in these parts," I found myself saying
drily in the back of my throat. Meg was staring at me. I made
an attempt to put my eyes off her.</p>
<p>
I nodded my agreement indicating I had heard the name.</p>
<p>
"Yes, Direxa. Of good Puritan stock, I added."</p>
<p>
She spoke no agreement this time and told me to consult her
if I had questions.</p>
<p>
"Direxa, she's long dead!"</p>
<p>
"I know, she still talks to me," Meg whispered turning to
walk away.</p>
<p>
In a typical fashion, I thought of the lore concerning the
supernatural adolescent reading had brought me--the Superstition
mountains of Arizona, dream time and the Darling range in
Australia's north, the Snowmen, the Wendigo tales of the
Coast Salish Indians. These, it seemed, were not more exotic
than the home spun tales of my province's eastern townships, Lennox
and Addington. Those two ghostly minutemen drilling in the
marshes of the Ontario Coomb, Canada's answer to the Fens
district of East Anglica. Strange, much as my presence here
volunteering information to a woman who freely talked in
lurid details concerning poor Humboldt's death but not of
cars that visited these roads at night, clairvoyance, poltergeists
or spells that bound her to a second home.</p>

<h1>THE NIGHTLAMP</h1>
<p>
Like a wail in the back of an inflammed throat came that
protracted noise once again. Interminably, the rhythmic pitch
of pounding grew louder as if several loose stones had swished
themselves against the larger cylinder of his room. Already, the
steady rap of a hammer's edge oozed from night's blackness
disparate as a voice muffled in protest against an exhausting
load.</p>
<p>
Again, the unyielding barricade of sound renewed itself
much as a headlight might fall against the path of a dazed
woodland animal. The same enervating crust of unreality
accompanied this sound as must, he imagined, light that
focused itself upon a stunned rabbit at a roadside clearing.</p>
<p>
Steady now, it peaked again after a small hiatus interrupted
only by the staccato bumping of his own heart within thin
visceral walls. Catching the bed-sheets in his hand and moving
to switch the nightlamp on as his feet touched floor, Durfield
let his eyes grow accustomed to the bright light now filtering
across the room. Same turmoil as with the ruddy animal
immobilized in its tracks, he thought, excepting now the
darkness coiled in wait instead of that speeding car. Same fate,
he pondered, nearly aloud. No, not really, because I have a
vestige of control here, he reassured himself. The lamp-switch
allows me, of course, to commandeer the ignition keys to this
vehicular room. I have mastery of my environment, however
limited. The fawn or hare has no more free will in that regard
than a stone spinning upon itself through orbital space. The
animal freezing in its tracks is but a by-product of its own
misshapen destiny--a projection of inward fear itself. Instinct
knows only one route when threatened, he theorized. I, at
least, have that avenue of self-preservation plus the dimension
of reason. That and that alone separates me from the splattered
remnants of a deer against the highway. Its over-specialization
dooms or pre-dates its response. So very predictable, he mused
fingering the face of his big, green lettered clock. I'm different,
he began reassuring himself adjusting his eyes to the flooding light
a little less nervously. I have the calling card of reason plus an
instinctual nature. The two should compliment one another. Why,
take that accursed noise. I can attempt its categorization in hope
of dispelling the fear of the unknown. What's more, I can move to
lessen its impact or remove it altogether. In effect, I can take the
edge off its annoyance altogether and sleep peacefully for the rest
of the evening. If only I could identify its source!</p>
<p>
Still, it was so very still in the room now. It was as if the
advance of light had checked the noise, whatever its origin
acting as a deterrent to its raucous splendour. Yes, that's it, he
thought. The light in some fashion interfered or dispels the
racket that spawns the darkness. How irrational. What a
repudiation of his earlier thesis that man, as a rational being,
manipulated his surroundings as opposed to being the mere
lackey of circumstance. Yet, there was but one way to determine
the logistics of his theory, he reasoned. Apply brakes to
the light and brace oneself for the possible resumption of
the unearthly noise.</p>
<p>
Did he dare? Did he, in a Profroukian sense, care to
challenge the impetus of the moment--that crackle of sound
made as it darned a wavy edge over the liquid crack of an
audible wave? Could he presume to roll up his trouser legs, eat
the allegorical peach or clutch the parchment of his being to
prepare a loosing onto the gates of night? A strange synthesis
for a man priding himself on logic, he muttered quickening the
thought process. Carefully, he prepared himself for the
venture. Barely a flick away, he imagined a surge of electricity
to go rifling through the inroads of his body, illuminating in
garish sequence the duality of his true nature--lucidity and
ghost fear. He was ready to examine the Hegelian fusion of his
private universe.</p>
<p>
The light remained off. Unbearable became the mental
jousting going forth across the diameter of his brain, that circle
of intense inner reasoning. Yet nothing threatening had yet
developed. No formidable barrage of sound like the last time
just bare minutes before when the noise had tormented him so.
No creeping need to silence the unexplained droning that
parried his sanity. But where did that place his theory on
darkness and a correlation with the heightened noise's
proliferation? What if the noise should return when, say, he
awoke tomorrow in the luxury of a room bathed in morning's
warm gaze? How might he cope amid sheer inconsistencies,
such contradictions like that?</p>
<p>
Now the uninterrupted silence assumed growing
dimensions. There was nothing amiss, yet nothing resolved
either. The sound and fury existed in a mute silence, growing
within the totality beyond categorization. After all, it was
darkest before dawn. And when did a fat man look his most
corpulent--next to one deprived of flesh, of course. One could
not react too carefully juxtaposed against glaring opposites in
a universe filled with few resolutions. No, he would not be
lulled into a false confidence, into the luxury of seemingly
overcoming the mystery of his baffling noise. In all sincerity,
he must anticipate everything.</p>
<p>
Perhaps the very silence harboured little noises like maggots
invisible to the eye? Invisible, yet nonetheless there, brooding
for an assault beneath a limpid surface? Yes, the enemy--that
pestilent noise was still in its lair watching his fragile kingdom,
eyeing an opening, searching out his jugular. He would blunt
it, though. Under no circumstances would he crack. Not the
likes of him. Must remain calm at all costs, he cautioned
himself. He must remain master of the situation, not be
alarmed should the phantom noise return. After all, in
darkness lay his chance to test his theory of the sound's
interrelation with shadow. Without darkness, there was no
sure way to clear this mess up once and for all.</p>
<p>
The doctor searched again for a pulse, then shook a wearied
head. The bedclothes were damp with perspiration and the
room lay ajar with evidence of disarray. Durfield's eyes stared
voluminously through their sockets and seemed fixed to the
furthest wall of his bedroom. At the room's opening lay an
overturned table with the smashed remains of a deflected lamp
with its nightshade crumpled lying by the base of the wall.</p>
<p>
"I just got up for a drink in the minute of the night and
stumbled against the door," the younger brother was explaining.
"I could barely even see the door, honest. I didn't mean to wake
him or anything like that. He's given me heck before."</p>
<p>
The doctor closed the eyelids against pupils bulging in a
vaccuous profusion. He said nothing, but renewed his glance
at the broken glass and dark spot on the coiled rug where spilt
water had made a crevice-like opening over the linoleum and
upturned nightstand.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="#top">[26]</a></p>

<h1>THE STRONGBOX</h1>
<P>
"He was always the one to figure things," remarked Humboldt.
"Always the smart ass type, big jawed lazy bones--couldn't make
a good farmer out of that sort. Didn't want to do much of
anything 'cept run. All his money went on his car. Drinking
in the Richelieu most every night. I suspect that's where he
were coming from when it happened."</P>
<P>
Humboldt leaned back against the store front. Twice weekly
he'd take a cab into town to fetch sundry articles as he said--one
day went for shopping t'other for visitin'. Retirement had given him
the necessary time to concentrate almost exclusively on the latter.
This was the first trip in this week and already the day was abuzz
with talk of the recent mishap.</P>
<P>
"Now let me get this straight," Russell was interjecting.
"According to what Humboldt says, the car just plain left the
highway and crashed through the barrier where seven meets
the Bath road."</P>
<P>
"That's what Thompson was saying and he was talking to
the widder Jocelyn the very morning after. Makin' a run into
Kincaid and happened to see the downed guard-rail. Accordin'
to the widder, she was awakened late Saturday night by
the crash. She wasn't what you call definite seening how it was in the
middle of the night and all, but still claims it scared her half to
death the thought of that car entering the lake."</P>
<P>
"Serve's 'im right," Humboldt began again. "Probably smokin' drugs
and boozin'. Ain't no proper place for the likes of him, anyhow.
Just plain crazy. Why that Scots boy was a born no good. Heard
tell he let berries fall off their stems rather than pick them,
then go to town to buy a quart basket. Blamed foolishness.
Why me and Jimmy Robinson remember hayin' with their old
man when he'd fork a bale then sit under the tree and smoke.
Gave up farmin' good land to guard at Ronald Bay. Between stints
on welfare, of course. The two of them, Ester and he sitting in
that kitchen--too damn lazy to rototiller that garden. Had a big
bitch dog, Buzzy--tail like an ice pick that was always swishing
and chased my stock afore I got Scot to tie him down."</P>
<P>
The conversation slowly became a praise of working values
with an occasional homily to flaunt the more ensconced rural
virtues. Humboldt referred to the List brothers both dead lazy
and drinkers, too, as the dialogue became more dogmatic.</P>
<P>
"Seems he'd had to swear off the bottle or go blind,"
Humboldt continued.</P>
<P>
"And you know what List said? Guess I've seen all that's
worth seeing. He ended up in a sanitorium in Stephensville.
The other stayed on allowing bush to burst up through the
cement walk and a tree to come through the drive shed. Imagine
that."</P>
<P>
Humboldt and his friend were grinning the same wide smile.
Apart from an occasional story of their own garrulousness or
resentment against authority, their past was free of such tales
and they knew it. It was enough to make a man feel proud
knowing he had nothing to live down. Humboldt was cradling
a watermelon to take back. His time was old and he was given
to all sorts of quirks he would never have allowed himself but
even five years ago--like taking a taxi, selling part of his farm
or, worse yet, eating good weiners on any but festive occasions.
Such things, he had once remarked, were the very stuff of foolishness.</P>
<P>
The taxi would only take him to the end of the long lane.
Punctuated by his mailbox and an old haying shed, the driveway
was well over a mile from the house. The road was all that remained
of an old county line that had since fallen into disuse. Provided
considerable privacy, he thought, well in tune to his love of
isolation. Barring, of course, those bi-weekly ventures into town.
Yes, they were needed.</P>
<P>
Pulling the latch over the door and stooping to rekindle the
fire, many would have thought such an existence unbearably
dull. Not so, Humboldt. Since his sister had died it was true he
had sometimes felt the need for companionship but this was
a world of his own making. He felt the thrill of self-accomplishment
knowing it was his land. He was alone with memories. Quietly
rocking by the fire, he began to doze off, little thinking materials
like old magazines, old rags to start a fire lay strewn about the floor.
Basic cleanliness had been an early casualty since the sister's death.
Gone was the regimen of order and weekly cleans until now the
house was like a dusty candle box. Still, his was an orderly world.
Soft fashioned, it was free of the tatters that change brings. He
thought of the years, the steady labour in the fields, the thriftiness,
his distrust of banks, the big city--the new highway that had compelled
the sale of the "lower 40" and all the rest of that blamed idiocy.</P>
<P>
The fire was gentle and massaged the chill from his fingers.
An old man's fingers. Honest hands not creased with pleasure
but with familiar toil. He used to liken his life to that drive into
town. Steady, small pastimes where every bend was anticipated
before rounding it like the neat little farms all in rows. His warmth
was in the security of the knowable, he thought nodding off. He
was thinking little thoughts like strawberries in spring or what
the icy water must have felt like closing around the throat of
Scot. If he had only lived like himself, got into farming and
enjoyed life instead of dashing off to lose touch with reality.
Yes, old ways were best.</P>
<p>
"Seems we've got two things to stir folks up with in this
town," the officer, a new constable with the OPP in Kincaid was saying.</P>
<p>
"It looks like a routine blaze what with all the junk laying
around but we'll have to check out all possibilities seeing that
Humboldt had the reputation of having lots stashed away. We
all supposed the old man kept considerable money hidden in
the house. Checks confirm no bank accounts so a strongbox is
suspected. It may be that some of the damage here was not the
work of fire alone. These are things we would like to probe,
Jake, and would appreciate any help you might provide." The
officer was looking straight at Jake asking his questions
routinely, matter of factly.</P>
<P>
Jake surveyed the still smouldering ruins. Only the brick
chimney still stood. They had found Humboldt's body by the
door. Apparently a clear case of smoke inhalation before he
was burned. Yet the scene betrayed Jake's own involvement.
Surveying anew the debris, Jake began to reassemble recent
events and his stake in having Scot rob Humboldt. The policeman
was saying nothing of any valuables found on the dead Scot. This
worried him, especially those heirloom bits containing Humboldt
Bennett's name. Perhaps, perhaps yes I could figure that the money
spilled out of the wrecked car or a strongbox now lies at the bottom
of the lake, Jake was thinking to himself. Yes, that could very well
be, he thought.</P>
<P>
Still, I wonder, yes really wonder had Scot managed to
locate Humboldt's nest egg at all? And what if Scot's drowning
occurred before the robbery, before he could rob Humboldt at
all? If so, this would explain why no money had been found
and that no one so far had the presence of mind to connect the
two episodes. Or were the police withholding this information
for reasons of their own? Still, how could the two incidents be
woven together by the authorities when Humboldt was freely
talking of the Scot disaster only yesterday. Unless, yes damn
Scot, evidence was found of Scot rummaging around Humboldt's
property the day Humboldt was in town! That would be just like
Scot to disobey a good game plan!</P>
<P>
He was thinking now which, of all possibilities, would
implicate his name the least. Wiping his brow and trying to
remain calm, he pressed the investigating officer as any
concerned neighbour might. After all, he was Humboldt's
closest friend.</P>
<P>
Yet to Jake's mind another probability was presenting itself.
Humboldt, on returning home from his visit to town yesterday,
might have found himself robbed, his place pilfered and, in his
angst, knocked over a lantern or, worse, suffered a stroke in the
ensuing panic.</P>
<P>
"Can a coroner establish if heart failure occurred prior to
asphyxiation?" he found himself muttering half-absentmindedly.</P>
<P>
Jake was hoping so. Gingerly, he fingered memories of what
he would have done had Scot returned the night as intended.
Still, if all held true, there was nothing to implicate him, even if
Humboldt had died unexpectedly. Jake was in the process of
reassuring himself. All had been taken care of. Scot dead and
now the car a convenient shambles--the only possible source of
clues or evidence. How tidy fate had been. Strange. If only he
had managed to get the money prior to Scot inadvertently
doing away with himself. He smiled, how lucky he had been.
Especially now, that Humboldt, too, was dead of God knows
what and he, he was no worse off for his pains. He still might
locate a cache or two on the property when all this blew over.</P>
<P>
The other side of Jake's personality was now exerting itself,
the peasant cunning of folk long inured to the earth's
rhythmic cycles. He knew of the officer's steady gaze and his
ploy. The officer was playing it smart, letting Jake see all the
possibilities when asking his opinion. First mention the near
likelihood of a robbery but be vague on the question of
accomplices. And, of course, the question of the necessary
instigation. Jake was wondering if he were looking a little too
detached from his friend's death. A little too sincere? Then
there was the issue of a second coroner if the evidence seemed
inconclusive. Wild fantasies swept through his now activated
brain. Did he dare? Might he risk it? Would the officer be .. .
well receptive to a little more ... er fact finding? And the best
way to approach him? Hmmm.</P>
<P>
Jake stared at the charred hulk of a bedpost. Humboldt's?
The long deceased sister probably. He couldn't rightly tell but
did recall Humboldt hadn't removed the bedding at the time of
her death. Either way, he mused, he would have to let events
take their course or steer them back his way at once. He
pressed his manured boot over a darkened brick kicking it free.</P>
<P>
"Am I free, uh, to go?" Jake asked the constable.</P>
<P>
"Free to go, why, why shouldn't you be Mr. Wright?"</P>

<h1>THE SANDPIT</h1>
<p>
Bertrand had been surprised by the recoil of his father's rifle.
He had not prepared for the sight of the weasel pasted against
the barn door, a dozen pellets alone penetrating its upper neck
and mid-thorax region. A mass of blood and fur seemed to
have been twisted onto the vicinity of the latch then held in
place as if from afar by many bullet-like prongs. Surely, the
calibre of the shotgun was too strong for his choice of game.</p>
<p>
Bertrand had a tendency for overkill. Possessing a
temperament and a super-charged imagination that demanded
structure even when little existed naturally, his mania for
organization had presented itself on innumerable occasions
about the homestead. There had been the case of his clearing a
brood of starlings from the drive house. A messy business, if
you let it but from one Bertrand would not flinch. A half dozen
squawking, flightless birds coiled above the door in the attic
were disposed of. After all, it was his job to end the clatter and
they were an obscene, noxious bird what with laying their eggs
in songbirds' nests and crowding out more desirable species.
Moreover, their very presence constituted an eyesore and that,
coupled with their grating noise, concluded their fate. They
were pests, simple and unadulterated, and on a farm any such
nuisance had to be wrenched aside. Still, he had not drowned
them like unwanted kittens or burned them out like that nest of
yellow jackets in the currant bush. A simple twist of their neck
either between the fingers of his leathered gloves (he disliked
the feel of flesh on feather so this necessitated hunting for a
thick pair of mittens), or placing the head of the screaming
nestling under one's boot did the business. Almost effortlessly,
but again nothing about tending land was done entirely
without deliberation or exertion. Structure and foresight held
things together. It was the nature of the beast.</p>
<p>
And so it was with Bertrand's decision to hunt bees. The best
method to oust any hive from its perch, so talk ran, was to
wrap an old cloth about a stick and daub it with flammable
pitch. Once lit, it made an impressive torch and could be
brandished against pests of any description. As a kid, Bertrand
recalled killing bumblebees in the old woodshed with a fly
swatter. Now that was some kind of action which allowed the
adversary manoeuvrability above and beyond that of skulking
bees with a flame or killing baby birds. The enraged swarm
would charge out from paper lairs encircled about the inner
walls of a shed through whatever chinks or holes led to their
tormentors. A little smoke applied judiciously, moreover,
would send dozens piling out the holes in threesomes so that
only a good, well balanced swat could hope to silence several
existing at once. At times, the bees would threaten to get the
upper hand and Bertrand and a friend would get panicky,
think of the Alamo or just about any heroic last stand made
possible by sheer courage.</p>
<p>
Once, as a torrent of wasps had flown angrily out a large
chink in the wood, Bertrand had been hit squarely in the
forehead causing him to abandon his post leaving poor Alex a
near victim. Fortunately, fear had given proverbial wings to
their feet and they had outdistanced the swarm out the shed
toward the relative safety of the house. In recalling the story,
endless rejoinders were made back and forth as to what would
have happened had a river been the only salvation. Could they
have outfoxed the bees, held their breath long enough and
swam the distance or would the cagey bees, if pressed, have
waited patiently above the surface to wreck revenge? Bertrand
did not have answers to these questions but it made for good
speculation, bravado and late evening entertainment. Killing
enraged bees with a swatter or the end of a broom or plank was
keen sport and one culled with knife edge excitement. He
craved excitement almost as much as his regimen demanded
rigidity. And to be fair, he had heard all wasps were quite
savage and retained venom in their sting that could prove
lethal to the elderly or infirm. It was a quick rationalization,
then, to believe such creatures were of the same stock and trade
as weasels, starlings or the other unwanted denizens of his
father's farm. Why, more people died of wasp stings than of
snakebite in North America annually. Something had to be done
about that outrage.</p>
<p>
Late summer is a time yellow jackets have primed their
airborne paper lodges with enough sustenance needed to carry
through from fall to winter. Some mature nests average the
breadth of a good sized milk pail but Bertrand had heard tell of
an occasional oddity exceeding the circumference of a waste
paper container. Just the thought brought the fire into his eyes.
Oh, to find such a one on a search and destroy mission then
lodge a tent pole up its arse! A good bout of artillery practice
might then follow--rocks at 40 paces until the enemy had been
given a sound thrashing. They shall not pass was the watchword
of the night.</p>
<p>
Alex had been reluctant to accompany Bertrand northward
through the lower forty toward 3 mile wood. For one thing
Bertrand had not been specific about the actual purpose of the
errand so he had surmised it to be mere peg-legging or a chance
to kick up a little steam. What finally swayed him was the
mentioning of a visit to the sand pit toward the end of the
miles. Now this was something he had rarely visited and it did
present some possibilities for exploring. In spite of warnings to
stay clear of the pit, every boy along the river had a fascination
with the dunes and gorges pock marking that bit of earth. Wind
sculptured landforms notwithstanding, imagination unfettered itself
in myriad forms that stretched from shades of Arabian Nights to more
recent movies wherein the protagonist had to climb a seemingly
endless mound of sand to fulfill a sadistic command. Plenty of ammunition
there! Perhaps something to the effect of double nought seven might be
conjured from that heap of sand.</p>
<p>
Images of gouged out earth, mole hills and a troglodyte's
existence in the trenches of Verdun flickered across Bertrand's
mind. An old grandfather and trunks of adventure books in his
attic had fascinated him with story after story around a
winter's fire about men burrowing like moles during World
War One. This and the primeval urge to dig and bury lurked
fiercely in the breast of the newly erect carnivore, the man
child.</p>
<p>
It was not long in coming. True to form during the
woodward trek, a wasp's nest had been located and, once
clubbed with a stick, yielded a livid horde. What was more, this
time no adventure book heroics took hold. Instead, stung and
dazed, his face a mass of welts, one of their number crashed
through brambles and thickets toward the sand and gravel pit.
In a few more strides, Alex would be over its outer perimeter
spiralling down endless chutes of dirt. Suffocation and the
random jerk of limbs caught in some nightmarish bog would
overpower any resistance.</p>
<p>
In a mind made panicky with fear, Bertrand recalls a spate of
facts from the natural world. Any item grounded in natural
fact was accredited with near reverence and infallibility.
Alex's upcoming fate would even be held explicable if seen
through this context.</p>
<p>
Wasps in their predator state have been known to render
spiders senseless, then bury them encrusted with eggs.</p>
<p>
An ant lion will dig an entrapment, then hiding behind a
blind, await the unwary.</p>
<p>
Caterpillars are butchered by flying insects with jaws
extended for that sole purpose of slaughter. Less luckier ones
live on as hosts for mounds of greedy larvae.</p>
<p>
Bertrand stirred himself from his covering. Having climbed
into a low lying cavity of limestone shelves, he was able to
elude his pursuers. His thoughts wander again to Alex. Had
Alex heeded local caution concerning the sand pit in his panic
stricken flight? Unlikely, as Alex was unclear of the exact
presence of the quarry and could not be expected to realize its
many treacheries if terror stricken.</p>
<p>
Like the starling young, Alex had been sluggish, refusing to
be stirred until prodded by a stronger outside stimulus. And, as
with the nestlings, Alex had succumbed to laws red in fang and
claw, cause and effect relationships.</p>
<p>

<h1>THE WAGER</h1>
<pre>
	"We think by feeling. What else is there to know."
				Theodore Roethke

</pre>
<p>
"I can live an adventuresome life vicariously through my
characters. It's inexpensive and a dandy form of ready made
self-expression. The perfect sort of sublimation exists after all.
For years I wore myself out trying to amass enough experience
to commence serious writing. You know the having to see all
and do all syndrome. I realize the pursuit of that plateau s
sheer idiocy as it remains ever distant as one grows older."</P>
<P>
Wenceslaus at that point placed his pen down and turned to
open a glossy picture print of a ship under full sail, a clipper
mail packet on the China run over a century ago.</P>
<P>
"Shakespeare never experienced the myriad situations he
subjected his characters to--how could he--except perhaps
subliminally. Jules Verne must have employed a similar type of
wish fulfillment with his prophetic writings that splashed a
hundred years into the present. What I propose doing is to
animate my earliest atavistic yearnings in a like fashion. I hope
to give scenarios embedded in the innermost recesses of my
psyche time to materialize, to exude from the substance of
dynamic characterization. In short, the cave wall pictures
Plato mentioned, hitherto until now dim and elusive flickers,
will become flesh and bone entities within their own right."</P>
<P>
Wenceslaus reached back propping a foot against the table
containing an old woodcut with some masking tape and a copy
of Stendal's Rouge et le Noir. I thought of him subconsciously
acting out the role of his many anti-heroes by parading their
values through the pages of his many would-be books. Rather
impatiently I moved to counter his studied expression.</P>
<P>
"And what of actual events rooted in your own experience?
How will you give your characters real presence, an allowance
to take away from them unintentional archetypes or woodiness?
What are your chances of breathing life into these shadow forms
without some common backdrop with which to share a basic empathy?"</P>
<P>
He continued to maintain his stare, not even breaking the
gaze to light a cigarette or reach for his mug of coffee. He
replied with a little annoyance.</P>
<P>
"Words, nothing but smoke screens to conceal a bankruptcy
of the thought process. How on earth do you propose I make
love to every woman alive, explore every crevice of this earth?
Surely, you aren't serious with this mumble about animating
characters. I propose to let the characters speak of real
ingredients through the force of actual events."</P>
<P>
"Animation is for cartoons, not serious playwrights. I'm
surprised at you," he went on. "What you are advocating is a
bilateral pool of shared traits. I venture to say such a thing is
not only patently absurd but unnecessary." He had let the
coffee grow cold and turned to it with renewed annoyance.</P>
<P>
The wind, it seemed, too, was expressing a little of the
afternoon's short-tempered.</P>
<P>
"Pity we live in this climate. All bluster and snow. Hardly
the stuffing from which romantic heroes are made," he said
stiffly.</P>
<P>
"And what of Tolstoy, London, or Service?" I nearly whined
back at him. "They used lack of glamour in their settings to
their advantage. Primeval landscapes are not only physical but
the force behind many a fanciful mind. That's the artificiality I
was concerned with earlier. Next you will be playing the
Gauguin adventurer convinced your lack of inspiration or
ready talent is attributable to March weariness rather than to
personal shortcomings. You will spend all your time searching
for that thatched cottage in picturesque Arly country."</P>
<P>
"Let me offer some more unwanted advice," I said, renewing
the attack. "Remember the example of William Turner, the
English landscape painter? He embodied in this next example
what I attempted to clarify by argument. In crossing to Calais
he had himself strapped to the mast at storm's height so that he
might better witness the pummeling of his own ship. A breakthrough
in the use of colour lead to the hey day of romanticism and
preparation for neo-impressionism. This all came through one
man's willingness to live events in the flesh not by haphazard
random reading."</P>
<P>
Wenceslaus was staring out the window apparently unmoved by
what I, in my vanity, thought the near-definitive illustration.</<P>
<P>
"So you suggest that for me to write effectively about a given
period I must breathe the very strains, the odours, verisimilitude
of the age? By that account no one would be accredited teaching
Macedonian history unless he first had witnessed the Hellenic revival
in the first millennium before Christ. I would bloody well have to be
impervious to all the dictates of common sense to follow through on your
suggestions!"</P>
<P>
"To prolong your garrulous argument, let me continue with
this case in point: to understand the problems of the blacks or
talk intelligently about the colour bar I would have to dye my
skin and assume the identity of a Negro. Is this correct?"</P>
<P>
"Well, hasn't that been done?" I replied carefully.</P>
<P>
"Yes, but not for the reasons you advance."</P>
<P>
"For sociological reasons, for the sake of novelty to do ...",
he finished with a gesture.</P>
<P>
"This argument is growing stale and circular, he began
anew. Quite frankly, I grow tired of you and your pedantics.
You remind me of the Medieval Schoolmen and their emphasis
on clarification to the point of excluding Truth. Yes, even Truth
if it could not be neatly packaged in their air-tight groupings."</P>
<P>
I perceived Wenceslaus, in a moment of understatement, to
be more than a little disaffected.</P>
<P>
"And isn't it you who argues the finer shades between
thisness and whatness, thickness and opaque intrusions at this
juncture?" I was now needling him with his own wealth of
details.</P>
<P>
"Opaque intrusions," a bewildered smile now entering his
face.</P>
<P>
"Take out your razor, Ockham." [1]</P>
<P>
Wenceslaus fingered the mug more openly. I didn't know who was
baiting whom. I thought I had bested him but realized in doing so
I was only personifying the shallowness I strove to dismantle
through argument.</P>
<P>
"Wenceslaus, Wenceslaus, let's cease this before emotion
colours our better judgment. Let us stop for the time being and
let a wager stand."</P>
<P>
"A wager?"</P>
<P>"Yes, you know of Pascal and his wager on faith?" </P>
<P>"Vaguely, but I'm tired of this thumb-pressing."</P>
<P>"I know, but hear me out."</P>
<P>"What we wish to establish here," I began, "is the superiority
of experience over imagination, actual events to intellect."<P>
<P>"Precisely," I maintained. "Let each of us do a
bibliographical survey establishing the whereabouts of most
authors' inspiration. The Muse as it were, that is the point
whereby a given author is ready to grasp order from the chaos
of eclecticism. Not exhaustively, of course, just a random
selection of say ten and then report back to one another. Each
must promise to abide by the general consensus of the search."</P>
<P>
"Such a thing will deteriorate to mere sham, a freshman's
guide to the use of periodical literature, he parodied holding a
hand aloft like a scolding professor."</P>
<P>
"It's one step in the direction toward delineating how others
reacted to a similar problem."</P>
<P>
"Fair then. We'll try it. But isn't it doomed to a split vote by
the very choice of our authors, we having had some previous
contact with their lives and thus knowing under which force
the man propelled his search?"</P>
<P>
"Partially, but we are after the division point, that hiatus in
time whereby each no longer procured experience but began to
write. That's our quest. The movement towards actual writing,
why the mood descended on whom when it did at its precise
locus in time."</P>
<P>
"Locus?"</P>
<P>"Yes you know locus, in mathematics."</P>
<P>"What have we accomplished," he said turning to me
wearily.</P>
<P>
Tongue in cheek I replied by his very gestures he was
experiencing a weariness with the thought process and
embarking on the need to try the experience route.</P>
<P>
"Sophistry," he cried aloud. "Pure bullshit. But we will let
the wager stand and upon it our friendship, our acquaintanceship
all I associate with the likes of you and yours. And, further,
for argument's sake, argument itself."</P>
<P>
"Aye, let all that stand and more. Let's get Faustian about
this and raise the tempo, I nearly implored. One, by virtue of
his defeat must swear off writing for a full three months. He
must promise not to desecrate paper with tainted thought until
the ink of this clamour gels as a sturdy lesson to his
peevishness."</P>
<P>
"Awkward, but interesting. Continue."</P>
<P>
"Nothing more, just this little writing circle shall have the
papal rite to banish anyone from its blessed entourage for
violating the tenets of established truth. Let's rest our case for
argument's sake, on this and all that has transpired today"</P>
<P>
My companion was working on a pair of stubborn galoshes
as I prepared my coat for a quick exit through the snow.</P>
<P>
The workings of Truth, all debate seemed so pointless after
all--just an elixir for resentment with the shifting sands of
mood ever ready to wash away any permanency. Like snow,
words reigned as queen of the elements for an appointed time,
then they, too, passed away.</P>
<P>
I had the feeling I had witnessed more than a huffy outburst
within myself against winter's dreary confines or the frustration
of a limited talent.</P>
<P>
I had expressed the narrowing of tolerance and the box
canyon of a roped spirit that clamours for freedom on the wind
of a signal fury.</P>
<P>
I paused and went forth into the storm.</P>

<h1>ERRANDS</h1>

	<pre>
	We repeat, the aim of the IRA has always been the liberation
	of our homeland. Any who aid or abet the enemy must fall full
	prey to force of arms.
				(The Republican Proclamation)

						 </pre>
<p>Somewhere in the distance a dog kept at his baying. A long
mournful whelping that seemed torn from the damp night's
very throat. Sean could not help but hear it; so deeply did the
dog's vocal cords implant sound upon human ears. He could
not help but think of the provos warning nuzzled like that
dog's steady cry over and over into the fabric of one's memory
swift as searing iron.</p>
<p>
"Aid or abet," he murmured softly to himself, "a long
distance is covered by such a comment."</p>
<p>
His Catholic heritage did him no justice in resolving the
torment. By birth, name even appearance and occupation--all
such persuasions meant he should embrace what the Republicans
preached. One no sooner got his name on their lips, Sean Paddy
MacGuire than they knew him Catholic. Two grandfathers had
died in the troubles prior to Erie's break with Westminster.
That alone should dictate undying hatred for the English and
their stooges, the Prods, in Ulster. He found little comfort,
though, in the ever continuing war of nerves. Yet the manifesto
bade every Catholic to think with his blood and put shoulder to duty.</p>
<p>
Sean emptied his glass, left his seat at the window's ledge and
made for the tavern door. Sectarian violence often came to
pubs and was drawn clearly along denominational lines.
O'Leary's was an obvious target for Protestant extremists that
much he knew. Still, a man needed a pint from time to time so
he doubted if he would discontinue the practice.</p>
<p>
He shook his gabardine jacket clear of his arm and stepped
into the night. Overhead a moon glimpsing the clouds made
through an effortless sky. He might, should impulse seize him,
step through the border area of Protestant Ulster to reach his
home near Falls Road. Suddenly, the pub door became a fringe
of orange heat amid whirls of smoke. Barely clear of the doorway,
MacGuire was propelled by the force of the explosion's impact
clear of danger. Dazed and uncomprehending, the full realization of
his chance good fortune not yet registered, he stood watching the
flames etch their amber fingers through the archway into the pilings about
the roof. Elsewhere, two figures ran through the night scarce turning
to watch their most recent torching. Had he a revolver bringing them
down would have been matter of fact, at least the part of squeezing
several bullets in succession about their direction. He had no such
weapon and could only watch them make good their escape.</p>
<p>
From the vicinity of the blast Sean could make out only
engulfing fire spreading itself over the full circumference of
O'Leary's pub. Placing coat against face, he edged closer to the
door in hope of entering the building. Common sense told him
anyone in the interior of the pub would be cremated by now.
Foolish to speculate further about them, he winced. The
demolished doorway also seemed to exclude any survivors
since in all likelihood the blast had originated from those
quarters. Silently, he tried to reconstruct the former faces
about a room which minutes before had seen quiet patrons
sipping a pre-supper drink. He was close enough to peer about
the ruins of the entrance. A form or rather a booted figure face
down under what appeared a fallen beam lay motionless before him.
Astride the man, he half dragged then manacled the bleeding figure
clear of the surging flames. Ensuring his immediate safety, MacGuire
went a second time into the now inferno like remains of O'Leary's.
Conscious now of the enormity of the blast as sirens wailed and a
clatter of noise began, grim faced police and officers whose job it
was to make sense of such happenings began to arrive. He was about to
attempt a second entry when a wall of fire ended further heroism.
He could not visualize anyone surviving twin disasters of explosion
and torch. For a scant moment he watched the smoke billow into
the sky illuminating the shabby houses of the neighbourhood.
Nowhere could he find it within himself to hate. This surprised,
even frightened him. An utter exhaustion filled him as he turned to
see whom chance had allowed escape from the fire.</p>
<p>
His shadow cast a tower's presence about the parking lot
onto the prostrate form. Swallowing hard, MacGuire prepared to
stare into the face of the man he had carved from fire's possession.
In a single motion, once his fist grabbed the man's clothing, a muzzle
lay against his throat.</p>
<p>
"Thought I was through eh, damned Mickey," the fierce eyes
seemed to speak all at once. "I've killed tonight. I'd soon as kill
you now and complete the errand 'cepting I may need the
temporary use of your skin. Now get to your feet."</p>
<p>
MacGuire obliged the blackened face with nostril openings
gaping hate. Already he was calculating his chances. The area
was filling with people. The light from the raging building had
ended their darkness. The gunman shoved the revolver again
into his face. The man seemed to enjoy his threats of pistol
whipping and promised death. MacGuire looked once again
into the face more from force of the last twenty minutes'
unreality than any perplexity of fear.</p>
<p>
Got to think fast, must use the chance card of generosity for
all its worth, he thought.</p>
<p>
"I saved your life," he pronounced slowly. It met the
anticipated response. In that slow second when his gaze met his
assailant an opportunity afforded itself. The gunman in a
mock gesture of appreciation had trained the weapon barely
upward into his reach. In a single motion, half embrace and
step into his adversary's stride, he had the man over. MacGuire
was instantly aware of his opponent's strength. Enraged at the
ruse's success, he glanced a blow across the Catholic's
forehead.</p>
<p>
"Guess you're happy he's dead," the soldier was saying as he
helped wrap a bandage into place. "We're grateful for any
extremist's death. Makes our job a lot easier," he was almost
laughing now. Death wore such an ordinary face when it
courted so often.</p>
<p>
Sean had yet to reply. He was staring at the shovel with the
snapped handle. The blade had separated on impact against
the terrorist's head. The man was nowhere to be seen. Rescue
squads--the familiar ambulance, fire brigades were attempting
a body count in the rubble of O'Leary's.</p>
<p>
"Say, you alright? I said guess you're pleased you managed
to pull away from that one," the lively soldier virtually leered
as he pressed again for some comment.</p>
<p>
"The dog . . . his noise, did you . . . ."</p>
<p>
"No," the soldier stared uncomprehending.</p>

<h1>PONCHONTAS</h1>
<p>
Years ago, when life was too violent for any to live very old,
the Spirit invented a ruse to give great age to Man.</p>
<p>
Late one fall, Ponchontas was keeping a slow fire to smoke
his strips of salmon. It occurred to him that by stoking the
flames gently with bits of chips, the fire would burn not only
smoother, but more evenly.</p>
<p>
Ponchontas held the block firmly and brought his axe to
play on the extended limb. Suddenly, his grip faltered and the
blade struck flesh drawing blood. Panicky, he thrashed about
the sand scattering it into the face of the fire. Quite by accident,
you see, as his foot only convulsed the pain his bleeding arm
felt. One by one, the blood fell in drops then trickles, rivulets
until a veritable torrent seemed loosed. Ponchontas screamed
till the woods listened. The spirit that governs the pulp of the
wood and the sap to rise took pity on Ponchontas. It curdled
the sap to thick resins in the chopped wood and the gummy
resin fell to the forest floor. As it lay so glutenous, the Earth
Mother was also quickened to show sympathy. This she did by
touching the marrow of the hurting wood. By a thick chain of
being, Ponchontas felt his skin harden. The painful throb soon
began to leave the wound and the scar healed. Immediately, he
was on his knees imploring the spirits. He begged what small
favour he might return. The reply was instantaneous.</p>
<p>
"Liberate three husks in your crib."</p>
<p>
Then, with much saying and thoughts multiplying forth
within his head, he gave word to the council of Voices. Once
dispatched, the three ears lost their kernels giving old women
to this day their namesake of beady eyes. The abandoned
husks became their withered forms and sacks of corn were
found to be "old bags." The empty rinds became harridans'
cancelled lives. Tares in the fruit were seen as the trials and
vicissitudes of this life, wormholes as their tears. So, in an act
of mercy, old women and crones were born saving future
generations the misery of living too old.</p>
<p>
To this day, an old woman often has a husky voice and an
ear for medicine.</p>

<h1>THE BLOODFISH</h1>
<p>
A story about tears that became minnows and sobs large
fishes in their place.</p>
<p>
Once, when the sky was young and the spirits were
expressing their wishes, peals of light and thunder damaged
the heavens until they were swollen and purple. Rain fell like
leaves as the victors banished the fallen from the clouds. The
vanquished were ordered to supply the empty lakes with forms
fitting their previous ways. Swimming in oblivion, they only
stopped to rest in reed beds on August days when the Great
Spirit smothered his anger.</p>
<p>
The evil ones assumed the course of large blood fish scraping
the silt bottoms in reminder of their reduced state. All sorts of
creatures--the catfish with his whiskers to remind the new
creature man of his pre-human state and the eel and lamprey
with their sharp eyes to disclose to the world the inherent
baseness of their rebellious nature. The giant of the deep--the
sturgeon--had a sucker form mouth. Every time man lifted him
across the keel of a boat he would see his obsequious face
panting to the sky.</p>
<p>
In fact, when sturgeon or the spirit commanded to be pike
were caught, the thrash of their tails sent small tears as ripples
across the lake. These stirred sand people and minnows were
born. Each sob from dying pike's tail, doomed to a long toothy
snout for her disobedience by Manitou, formed a larger fish. In
this way, fish were ever reminded of their punishment and man
kept fed.</p>
<p>
The Indians enjoyed new food as plenteous as the grains of
golden earth on each lake's face.

<h1>THE GARDEN PATCH</h1>
<p>
Gourd was taken to task when she understood the
limitations the garden patch had placed upon her people.</p>
<p>
It was early fall and the dancers of the vegetable kingdom
paraded their charms in bright, full regalia. Across the earth in
splotches of colour, the tomatoes scented a good fall. So, too,
the kingly husks of corn and the melons, spinach and cucumber
in turn eyed the approaching season in growing faith. Each had
a succulent function and dangled their inviting flesh to the beholder.</p>
<p>
But, alas, what did gourd promise? She was deeply
conscious of lacking the forward brightness of tomato and
pumpkin. She lacked leafy greens so evidently prized and when
her fellow vegetables covered the brown soil in preparation for
the fine day they would bask across a kitchen table, it was
almost too much for the sensitive gourd to stomach. Why even
squash, which she felt closest to, had more of a function than
she. So versatile did the big neighbour seem in comparison to
herself, the ugly dwarf.</p>
<p>
She was on the verge of casting herself in despair across the
rickety fence or joining the long, black embers of a dead fire
young boys had prepared months back. Surely, she was the
outcast of the plant world. How grotesque her features were,
so hard and unpliable seemed her flesh. Even her skin tones
were half-caste. No recipes called for her presence. A mood of
growing helplessness seemed to envelop her.</p>
<p>
A boy, the earlier fire setter, is describing an odd vegetable,
tubular and often misshapen, that was excellent for all sorts of
childhood pursuits--making paperweights, building scarecrows
and decorating mantles.</p>
<p>
"If only people knew," he bubbles.</p>
<p>
"Still more success stories," the little gourd cries on hearing
the child's comment.</p>
<p>
"At least I won't have to be humbled in her presence," the
gourd thought, her self confidence shattered.</p>
<p>
And with that the little gourd approached the Vegetable
King and asked to use her remaining wish. For in those days all
living things were handed one means for improving themselves.</p>
<p>
"I resolve to be a new edible," she sighed, "something other
than a gnomish gourd. Make, O King, a glorious . . . pumpkin."
But the Vegetable King decided not to abandon his earlier
invention and so gourds live on. Distant relatives of the bright,
new pumpkin, but their inspiration nonetheless.</p>

<h1>THE MONARCH</h1>
<p>
She wanted her beauty too soon and must now forfeit it for
the moment.</p>
<p>
One day, when the Earth was a glorious garden and ruled by
a brilliant sun flower towering above the plants of her domain,
Monarch butterfly, not yet her familiar orange, complained
she wished to be large as a bird with petal wings translucent to
the sun, folding with the rain. Sunflower, taken back by this
unusual demand, sought to humble Monarch.</p>
<p>
"Henceforth for your imprudence, each one of your race
must toil for your wings. No more shall you enjoy fruits
without labour. By daring to be mighty you will begin existence
as a pale, green egg hardly distinguishable from the lowliest leaf.
Moreover, as a reminder of your insolence, you must pass through
four purgatorial stages. The bitterest bane of your people will be
the bread of the milkweed."</p>
<p>
"You wish to aggrandise yourself? So be it--you will shed your skin
like a snake and hang upside down in stupor for weeks on end.
Only then, will I allow you to retain your former excellence."</p>
<p>
And with that, sunflower drew hard upon her curse and
winter formed. She, too, planted seed-eggs across the face of
the earth. Her face lost its radiance by fall and her petals cried
to the ground. Even today, when people eat of her wealth they
devour it with salt. This is in remembrance that, in cursing
Monarch, she, too, felt her own wrath for salt is more bitter
than the bane of the milkweed.</p>

<h1>BR√âBEUF</h1>

Br√©beuf is looking at the land that bears his namesake. He
has no recollection of the horrors to come for his gaze unfolds
as if in a dream.</p>
<p>
The wide expanse of blue water pleases him. Certainly the
area holds potential--many hard and softwooded trees not
unlike his native Brittany. In the warm glow of a July morning,
he belittles his misfortunes, the present trials sapping little Ste.
Marie.</p>
<p>
The kindly father dashes the recent sleep from his eyes with
cold brook water. The shimmer seems to fit the haze his
current thoughts pivot in. Sweet water country might yet prove
both fortress for Christian souls and strength at feeding Louis'
New French dream.</p>
<p>
The sun is no longer in the sky. Instead a ghoulish orange
disc fastened between sharpened sticks is brought closer and
closer to the white face. He is maddened with pain. The
circular nature of the mind in torment flits to the earlier
morning rumination. Someone spills part of a hissing kettle on
the fire in mock ritual of the Baptism. Too abundant waters, ah
yes that could prove a difficulty in cultivating this pleasant
land. The swinish feast in preparation re-echoes thoughts of
ample provisions so vital to this distant land.</p>

<h1>CITY THE INSECTS INVADE</h1>

	"From the indigo straits to Ossian's seas, on pink and orange sands
	washed by the vinous sky, crystal boulevards have just arisen and
	crossed, immoderately inhabitedby poor young families who get

						Arthur Rimbaud

</pre>
<p>
The old man sleeps with his weeping. Another old one
pauses with her cats on a fire escape while nursing a sore like a
precious stone. A garbage can is an herbivore grazing on
stalks of ringworm. Vermin are the pool sharks of this brothel
polishing off the tenements' fur lined rails.</p>
<p>
At last, the skid of tires tears a hole in the river bank.
Sand-fleas and blowflies become nightriders marauding a new
turf of godzilla cars. An urchin dangles his stolen wristwatch
like a fish in a bottle while shoals of centipedes make a beeline
in a poseidon stampede. Filthy rags are prayer cakes left over
from the last sabbat and become holed coffins for those still
searching for involvement.</p>
<p>
Islands drift into protoplasm atolls as the city stalks itself.
Cockroaches are the plumbers of eternity. Rapid fire legs
sidestep the etchings of industrious ants while silverfish are the
boatmen trouncing human oars. Living is a Stegasorous swinging its tail.</p>

Scraps are inviting guests as insects lord over a habitat free

blonde with a slinkiness that ravishes the libido. She presses
her dream-like form against the windowpane. The night is soft
about the city's lights. Water cascades in the distance, while
small, black crickets' shovel sounds around pricked ears. The
diminished man ignores this, instead busying himself with
drawing lions on a vast sheet of blank paper. There is no word
for happiness in the Malawi tongue and this disturbs him.
What far reaching implications for the people of Africa.</p>
<p>
He stands and downs a drink to ease his parched mouth. A
moisture ring blurs one of his lions, and, again, he will lose
the battle against the king of beasts tonight.</p>

<h1>SUMMER'S CLOCK</h1>
<pre>
	" . . .and the day is a wounded boy."
			Garcia Lorca
</pre>
<p>
Two is a fonder number gracing the clock than one--a relief
from monogamy, a rightful place to start. Three is too midway,
cantankerous in its sound, still four is drab and stony and the
sun lies too low in the sky for any truthful expression of real
afternoon. Five is somewhat better, the sky is pressuring
evening and, by six, is big with shadows that foresee the coming
dark.</p>
<p>
With seven, ambers and misty wraps are charged in pastel
tones celebrating the arrival of eight. At nine, all pretense is
dropped that its still daylight and colours lie bludgeoned--extinguished
in the dark. Ten through near dawn is blissful and quiet, no confusing
escapades of shifting light. Only the hour before dawn promises a
summer respite any different than the cue sung at midnight.</p>
<p>
The absence of colour and light diminish confusion over the
sun's relative positioning. One need experience no mood
fluctuations over birth or hasty departure of the day. In the
broad smile of no light, the frock of virginal black remains securely
intact.</p>

<p>
Now, it came to pass that a seasoned young diner by the
name of Simon decided to revolutionize the restaurant trade.
It was his firm desire to bring some chutzpah into the all too
predictable and dreary cuisine on this part of the continent.
From the first, Simon maintained that food and pleasure were
inseparable. Moreover, since food could be a vehicle for fantasy,
even more tellingly it could provide an outlet for self-expression.</p>
<p>
The lily pad pizza was typical of his new approach and was a
twofold operation: a parent might buy an inflatable plastic
"pizza," the size and shape of a small wading pool. It had an
edible spout and dehydrated "sister," pizzas attached to the
parent ship that allowed a child to fantasize while sailing and
enjoying his favourite food. If that sounded too decadent or
illusion inspiring, a sleeker model existed minus the extras--in
other words the green wading pool size pizza unruffled by
further wizardry.</p>
<p>
Simon always maintained not everyone could handle too
much soft-pedalled reality. Out of the dense formations of
endless fast food chains, Simon's novelties were to titillate the
jaded restaurant goer.</p>
<p>
Interpretive signs and amenities guided the erstwhile
onlooker to the "ultimate," in fantasy dining. Rhinocerous
pizza was served flanked on an inflatable horn. For the less
adventuresome, a lobster pizza with drawn butter could be had
either with tangy dough balanced along its claws or imprints of
lobster cut into the succulent crust. Children loved the lily pad
pizzas and mothers discovered how delightful baby tears were
when presented in tastefully done little cups. Terrariums soon
arrived and were pedalled shamelessly. Some outlets claimed
"billions and billions," were sold.</p>
<p>
Simon also cornered the potent swamp water drink market
and was having his empire go "wet." The familiar Chartreuse
would now be available at request and a grown up might
indulge primal fantasies along with a taste to be a gardener,
rake and glutton all at once. Special suites were rumoured to
exist patterned after the Poconos in Pennsylvania where a
couple could bathe in a pizza-shaped tub embroidered with
baby tears, fountains, tropical lianas and all the air plants one
could stand pressed against your steamy shower. Pizza machines
for a quarter lined the tubs and one operation had dispensed with
coins altogether issuing instead rubber baby tears that substituted for
money. They could be strung around the neck like shark's teeth. Swamp
water in little jars added a further touch to this risqu√© scene.</p>
<p>
But, of course, for the really discriminating the boar's head
feast was the sign of a truly adventuresome palate. A Black
Forest effect could be conjured up complete with moveable
props. A pig's head stuffed with not the familiar apple but
instead each tusk hollowed bulging with pizza. Another
version saw rhinocerous shaped pizzas rolled in the style of
Yap Island discs, that land being noted for its odd wheel like
currency. A boar's head contoured in the recognizable shape
but with tusks only made of pizza was a favourite alternative.
After all, gourmands bought escargots in order to fill their
shells then, after washing, repeated the process on future
occasions. And, most certainly, no one could deny that Simon's
ideas were anymore outlandish than the epicurean Romish feasts
of peacock tongues and assorted other naughty delicacies. His was
but an updated version appealing to the mobile North American
lifestyle. Frisbees even began to resemble pizza and trampolines
approached that air. It was all the rage to be Italian and boast of
one's prowess in demolishing mounds of pizza.</p>
<p>
Yet trouble was afoot for Simon and his proteges. The very
real puritanical element in society saw Simon's chain of exotic
pizza emporiums in the same league as exotic dancers and
sought to banish them, seeing that gluttony was akin to lust.
Therefore, pizza pie body parlour rubs began to vanish.</p>
<p>
Moreover, peevishly spiteful children insisted on spreading
rumours that Simon's operations used day-glow worms as
substitutes for pepperoni and unwashed algae as a base for
pasta crusts. People began to question the wisdom of letting
children act out their fantasies with food as that commodity
was a very emotional subject and a testing ground for good
parenting. Psychologists soon began to join the harangue and
claim the pizza emperor was a poorly toilet trained debauchee
acting out repressed impulses in the form of a greedy diner.
Some, in fact, claimed he was in the anal stage of his
development and that his taste was all in his mouth. Food
faddists and health nuts wondered aloud about the wisdom of
combining so much dough with gelatin plant fibre. It seemed
most everyone was rushing to deflate the pizza bubble and end
our love affair with the anchovy.</p>
<p>
Unemployed pizza cooks and pizza rub girls were soon at
the end of the dough line. In fact, so great was the influx of
misplaced persons that the term "on the dough," for a time
replaced "dole," as an euphemism for hard times. Extortionists
began to muscle in asking for their share of the pizza pie.
Newspapers began gloating over the imminent bust of the
"infantile," pizza passion.</p>
<p>
Still, Simon confided his trust in the same observation that
must have motivated Lord Sandwich when he launched his
invention. People will always search out the delicious and the
readily available. What could be more elementary than meat
between bread, frogs on lily pads, protein over raw vegetables,
food amidst food?</p>
<p>
Simon set his heart to selling automobile soft legs to hosts of
touchy epicures who really wondered at this juncture if
anything that unusual could really taste like chicken.</p>

<h1>THE PELLY, THE POWDER AND THE SNAKE</h1>
<p>
The cowboy's overriding presence in North America's
mythology is not difficult to understand.</p>
<p>
Perhaps the great lone land ethos of endurance, stamina,
self-resourcefulness and "a man's got to do what a man's got to
do," John Wayne brand of thoroughness, still endures more so
than once admitted. Talking in these terms usually elicits a
responsive chord. Everyone has felt that, at one time or the
other, only his carabine (wits) stood between him and the fate
accorded to the Sundance Kid. As life increases in complexity,
in all probability there will be a tendency to create myths or
revive tales from the past to help blaze trails. The westerner
personifies close shaves with danger. So, too, surviving in the
corporate jungle implies a similar fixation in manufacturing
responsive heroes to see us through.</p>
<p>
In one scenario, the setting of a gruelling contest at the
managerial level becomes "highnoon," for the Earp brothers.
The plug uglies in the vein of the Claytons are the bush-wackers
waiting to play upon any opening. The board room assumes
the air of OK Corral with old Doc Halliday leaning on the
fence or a tombstone, if the exchange goes dismally.</p>
<p>
Most of us would naturally see little identification with the
Renaissance condottieri or mercenary or understand the
Laager[1] mentality of the white South African. Yet we do have
some input into what the bounty hunter is capable of or the
ramifications of being dry-gulched by an insensitive or
unfeeling person. All have had to cross their Badlands, ride
roughshod above the timberline or grab for cover to avoid a
ricochet.</p>
<p>
The two legged coyotes are still with us no matter how
humanitarian we might fancy ourselves.</p>
<p>
The Ox-Bow Incident[2] can overtake most anyone, although
the saying "meeting one's Waterloo," seems at this writing more
commonplace. In ramrodding an outfit to market, or seeing a
plan to completion, all must stand clear of brackish water,
wolfsbane and loco weed. Place these symbolist terms in their
updated context and you will understand a hockey player's
nickname "cowboy," and the slow irrelevance of that veneer
time.</p>
<p>
A primeval instinct beckons through time to the campfire.
And I suppose a campfire logic might be said to exist in all of
us. The thinking of things out carefully over a second and third
cup of coffee, cautious self exploratory reasoning. Today, any
job ad will still warn: "Only the aggressive with a proven trail
record need apply." Myths and more myths, the saga makers
are legends in their own time, recreating themselves shamelessly.</p>
<p>
It may be time to pull on the reins, but allow one last
indulgence. Who is the modern centurion? The town marshal
finds his present niche in foreman, boss man, supervisor(?) The
heart is a lonely hunter and amidst renegades, mavericks and
poisoned water holes, the modern Cincinnatus[3] or wagon-master
will be found contending with an array of tenderfoots, greenhorns
and Jimson weeds up the Chisholm Trail through the Cimarron to
market.</p>

Chiggers, jerky, sweat beetles and hardtack are but
mementoes of this earlier romantic interlude.</p>

<h1>JABIRU</h1>
<p>
Clarence, the pipe stem would grow hot with rage, then
become agitated over his apparent inability to stop smoking.
You see, he was a misfit in more ways than one. He didn't snap
firmly in place when ordered, and more importantly, he
resented the appendicular attachment to a place and time not his
own choosing.</p>
<p>
Clarence would stew near the pipe bowl, rife with burnt ends
and hacking smoke. The pipe had a bite and it was he who
enlisted its bitter end.</p>
<p>
Now Clarence had designs of escaping tobacco road. He
envisaged a future free of pool hall smells and the glandular
malfunctioning of his predator owner. They say the stem of a
pipe pressed against one's tongue for extended periods of time
will cause aggravation, perhaps "malignant growths," worse
yet, cancer. To Clarence, however, it was he who was sickened
by the onrush of brown saliva and halitosis as his compulsive
partner pressed his bones to an opened jaw. He felt like Cain
and wished he could kill this man with the jawbone of his own
ass. At the very least Clarence wanted to be something more
than an after dinner pipe. He wished a certain notoriety, a
dance on pigeon feathers, to be a pipe of Nordic proportions--a
yard's length of smoke. If he was to be engrossed in smoke, he
at least wished it to arrive in exotic blends, from textures rich
with the warmth of their climes. Turkish root, jabiru, all were
curiously better than the stuffy domestics he had come to know.</p>
<p>
But alas, Clarence for all his fuming saw nothing ahead but
more of the depressing humidor. His lot was to be a rack in a
provincial smokehouse kept aglow by a poor man's fervour for
post-natal security. The additive was relaxation and his world
was to be as commonplace as the hearth. Home was a blackened
stem yellowing with age against a bewhiskered face. There was
no knowing when a pang of nicotine might hit, so he spent his off
hours in a coat pocket or a sleeve's rear end eyeing the world from
a very shaky distance. Life was indeed strange when one was rudely
hauled out of near hibernation into the brunt of day, stuffed into an
asphyxiating batch of tacky powder, then pressed into open flame.
Afterwards, further indignities were exacted as one's head was
slammed against the pavement or struck on the heal of a manured boot.
Existing was not sweet (barring Prince Albert) but likely to be hellishly
warm or worse, infuriatingly commonplace. Still, he comforted himself
on the knowledge Alex the cigarette could sense his end more dreadfully
as a butt in some pool-side urinal. At least, his demise would be a
trifling more dignified--or so he assumed.</p>
<p>
Now it came to pass that Clarence's owner was passing
through a metamorphosis of sorts where he believed a
meerschaum pipe would ease the tobacco habit. At once,
Clarence faced the twin prospect of being not only redundant
but phased out as an aging health risk. This was clearly the
siren call to action.</p>
<p>
Clarence thought of suicidal urges. He would lodge himself
in his owner's windpipe. He would fall from grace with a thud,
enmeshing himself in a thousand pieces at his distant relative's
feet. Least-wise, he would rot in a sewer near a busy bus stop
replete with all the dronings of archaic feet. Or, or he reasoned,
he would outwit his opponent and maintain his old hegemony.
Oblivion seemed a more forbidding fate than drudgery.</p>
<p>
For sometime, Clarence had watched the new meerschaum
from a distance. Its lily white figure elicited a plan. He would
disgorge from the pit of his favourite ashtray all the toxins
lodged in the burnt up tobacco. He would prove white was an
aberration. He and he alone would disfigure her perfection. A
good pipe should camouflage its owner's hazards. He had only
to tar and weather his rival or await the smoke to cloud the
delicate perfection of that effeminate form.</p>
<p>
Reveling in the sense of this new found power, Clarence
became puffed up with more than his own smoke, and his
thoughts fell into a dry rattle. The owner feeling this
unaccustomed rush of heat and experiencing hard drawing
from his companion, vigorously tapped the stem against an
open door's edge. He muttered something to the effect about
the clogged nature of his old instrument and how refreshing his
next smoke promised to be.</p>
<p>
And so it would, without the residue of filth lodged inside
the once trusty pipe.</p>

<h1>ADUA</h1>
<p>
Adua had never regarded his life as a pantomime. He
wanted so much to please. As a dandelion, he thought of
himself as little brother to the sun catching her yellow butter in
his eyes.</p>
<p>
It came as no small surprise, then, when Adua learned of the
world's misgivings toward him. Other flowers, far less nobly
constructed, seemed held in such greater esteem. The first
shred of evidence of this that Adua was indeed not a bountiful
plant came when cattle distained his presence. Later, a smelly
herbicide was used in his presence and Adua knew all was not
well. Most discomforting, however, was the manner in which
other flowers measured up in comparison to Adua. Even flowers
that Adua considered quite ordinary seemed, tongue in cheek,
to fare much more prettily.</p>
<p>
"Adua, Adua as the wind blows so do the poppies grow."</p>
<p>
Somehow, Adua heard that refrain while nodding his head
in the summer heat. He had grown accustomed to the red
blotches that spilled their colour so near to his own colony. To
him, their mauve crimsons were gaudy, a shrieking red quite
unlike his gentle yellow nectar. He was feeling quite smug that,
at least compared to that recluse, his kind were visibly better.</p>
<p>
But then, proximity to the poppy family started him
thinking. Firstly, unlike his brothers, the poppies were well
tended. A dutiful human watered and caressed the plants
commenting on the fullness of the pod and the grandeur of
their petals. Yet, all Adua could see was a lot of goitered
looking droopy herbage. As time went on, it became painfully
obvious that the big house and her attendants had established
clearly a floral arrangement that did not include dandelions.
Adua grudgingly admitted some of his cousins, in careful
manicured garden beds, deserved their swooning praise. But
not, not the poppies. Why, they were not even solid North
Americans like himself. They had no native roots in the solid
soil of his pastureland. The poppy was an Oriental import, too
foreign to be assimilated. And what of its reputation for
buccaneering. In some countries it was illegal even to grow
them! Wasn't it worse than the demon weed since its seeds
carried the substance necessary for narcotics? Surely,
anything brewed of opium should be shunned in real life.
Convinced of his moral superiority, Adua could at least
comfort himself with the realization his breed was of a fine
upstanding kind, even if reduced by circumstance to humble
origins. His kind went about their business peacefully enough.</p>
<p>
As summer ripened into fall after all dandelions had long
stopped blooming, Adua was content to pass his declining
months as a stringy plant. It was then Adua came to learn more
painful truths stalked the earth. Other flowers were plucked
for corsages, arrayed in stately carriages for banquets, had
toasts drunk to them and found themselves into the hair of
pretty maidens. The most Adua had ever seen his dandelions
construed for in the spring was a mere ringlet chain. True,
hardy souls brewed a concoction of dandelion wine but what
good was that if it was rebuked with taunts of "too bitter," or
"how crass,"?</p>
<p>
As the cold winds licked about him, gone were the memories
of his tussled gold headdress worn a season ago. He was about
to commandeer the last of his strength before frost demanded
his shop close for the winter. Through progeny produced
months before, his kind would spend the cold in tolerable
warmth as a seed. Germination was such a marvelous adventure.
And what of poppy'? Instead of feeling that burst of speed and sense
of the unknown flitting across creation as he had like a parachutist
ages ago, her brood had to stay bundled up in a pod. How dull, thought
Adua.</p>
<p>
Then, as Adua prepared to tuck himself in for the winter, life
handed him but one more setback. It was nearing the eleventh
of November, and a curious custom was presenting itself. To
be sure, Adua had seen real flowers adorn lapels of both men
and women as well as bridal wreathes of the most exquisite
colours. Yet, never had he seen a poppy, living or otherwise, at
the centre of adoration. He was mortified now to see imitation
ones worn as a symbol of remembrance, John MacRae notwithstanding.
How could she symbolize the dead of Canadian wars when he, Adua,
was a native son? Why, if you wanted to get technical about it, even
his name contained reference to a lion and to his mind that meant
courage. He was perplexed to see how Britain, with all her reliance
on that beast, had not seen fit to incorporate his kind as the founding
race should have done into her coat of arms. The Scots had their order
of the garter and a thistle, of all things, was emblematic to that
northerly land. Why not a dandelion even if it were a bit of a
dandy all dressed in that, shudder, colour of cowardice, yellow'?
People were so emotional choosing a red flower simply because
its colour reminded them of shed blood.</p>
<p>
Adua was hurt to the quick and could bring no comfort to
himself either in hope of future aerial flights or the prospect of
his greens being eaten next season as tasty helpings.</p>
<p>
There was nothing to do but sport a brown coat, suggestive
of the treatment the world had seen to give him.</p>

<h1>RIP</h1>
<p>
Rip, an inarticulate dog with a namesake derivative of more.</p>
<p>
Rip arrives as a pup, large, abounding with energy though
somewhat clumsy in his gait. But Rip is no matter of fact
bowser--the type that woofs approvingly at your presence then
is content to carry himself off to a corner and deliver up his
bulk with an unrelieved sigh. Nevertheless, one does suspect his
nose is wet (or as shiny) as a washcloth but such familiarities
are not extended to strange dogs.</p>
<p>
Rip's progress in his new home is eventful. Early in his stay,
he gleefully corners a porcupine and gets a face full of quills for
violating that one inescapable fact accorded to all life on this
planet; introductions are always in order in untried situations.
One must proceed with due caution through proper channels
or suspicion will ensue. Rip nurses a bandaged nose, sees the
inside of a vet's garage (replete with a scourge of animals more
reminiscent of a concentration camp than an infirmary) is duly
horrified, then droops off to a needle. While recovering, a
kitten perches on his upper abdomen and goes to sleep. A
thoughtful child covers Rip with an old rug. Rip's tongue
nearly flattens the mat as it lolls from his mouth. The edge of
his jaw is ringed with a black, tarry substance that grows more
viscous the longer Rip is under sedation. Rip's education
proceeds apace.</p>
<p>
By a queer turn of events, big Rip was to become associated
with a number of incontestable oddities, each sufficient to
besmirch his name. Firstly, Rip's very name popped up with
annoying frequency. How, the family queried, had the name
"Rip," been chosen anyway? Of this, no one seemed certain.
The father remembered some vacation talk when references
were being made to a rip roaring time and that, perhaps, a pup
would soon be in the offing. Apart from this, Rip's name and
how they had deigned to associate that foppish hound with
"Rip," remained a mystery. The children in their homework,
moreover, were increasingly being made aware of the times
"Rip," seemed to get in the semantics of the language, English
orthography and even the warp and woof of history itself.
Certainly, Rip or someone like him, had been outstanding.</p>
<p>
Rip Van Winkle's first disclosure caused one such stir. One
child particularly pressed for explanations. Had this other Rip
been doggishly inclined? Did Rumpelstiltskin have a brother
named Rip? No, repeated the mother unless the child's inference
was to Rip's great doggish capacity for sleep or Rumpelstiltskin's
spinning or spilling of hair or food. A second child, not meaning to be
overly precocious, similarly unearthed a red herring. Rip Taylor, the
comedian, had Rip's name. Was he, too, er . . . like Rip? The mother
smiled. Only in his buffoonery, but she, again, was unsure why either
Rip had been so named.</p>
<p>
Some days later, the children heard one of the older boys in
public school boasting of being "ripped," the weekend before.
The younger child, wary of being ridiculed but curious as to
this new utterance of the family pet's name, pressed for some
explanation. Utter derision. The child shame-facedly brought
the problem home. The mother, not trained in the lore of
schoolyard vernacular, thought the boy in question had
escaped a whipping for tearing something and was boasting of
his prowess in side-stepping authority. The father thought not.
He gently told the child that the wine the parents were enjoying
could be, well, "abused." One child immediately thought
abused was a reference to abusing one's body through self-exploration
or playing doctor but the father clarified that matter. A touchy exchange
followed over how something pleasurable caused harm. The mother
retreated into a homily--"all things in moderation," and told the
children they would understand as they grew older. The elder son
persisted, however, in questioning how something bad, if included
under the "all," as stated, could be either moderate or good depending
on the circumstances. He further demanded what reception the
schoolyard braggart would have given such sagacious counsel.</p>
<p>
Events were kept on slow boil over the following week.
It began to appear as if the issue was becoming only remotely
curious. Rip still dozed before the fire and wagged a buffoonish
tail in servile recognition. Then one day, on researching a project,
the son happened upon the term rip-tide. Further inquiries followed.
The hound, of course, had not the remotest connection with ocean
currents. Yet the origin of his nickname was as puzzling as ever.
Ripcords and ripoffs deepened the controversy. The rippling effects
of wind on sand, too, had to be dismissed out of hand as a key to Rip's
misnomer. Strange, too, that no one thought to question the
nickname Sandy as a touchstone for unraveling Rip's dilemma.</p>
<p>
Perplexity next turned to one Rin Tin Tin. He, too, had a
nonsensical name but his sanity and reputation escaped
unscathed, perhaps for no other reason than the sonorous
incantation of his vowels. To be called Rip, it seemed, was
nakedly plebian--a type of proletarian churl of the canine
underworld. Besides, substituting Rip for Rin seemed too
openly imitative and it didn't begin to solve what prompted the
naming of the family pet. It began to look as if all coupling of
objects and titles was, by its nature, inexplicable.</p>
<p>
The father then proceeded to bring a certain sophistication
to the broadening quandary. People, he ascertained, grew
towards their names. Positive, intriguing names were an asset.
Awkward, embarrassing ones, moreover, were definite obstacles
to progression in life. Did not Jack the Ripper have infamy forever
etched within his name? Maybe none ever took Doctor Cream
(alias the Ripper) seriously. And whose idea was it to substitute
R.I.P. on tombstones? But then a certain Ripley made a name for
himself by documenting the unusual so Rip wasn't the only one that
lived in a dog eat dog world. However, the evidence was not in as
to whether a dog could labour under a name's handicap.</p>
<p>
Then one afternoon, while engaging in the bravado of
chasing cars and attempting to bite their hubcaps, Rip miscued
and ran headlong under the wheels. Rip's entire frame rippled
with the impact of the collision. Thereafter, Rip indeed became
an oddity for more reasons than his name. Some say he became
psychotic, if indeed dogs are capable of such things. Barking at
imaginary postmen, baying like a banshee at cars, baring his
teeth at passersby, word travelled about this insufferable dog.
The father, skilled in avoiding unpleasantness, had Rip put to
sleep. The children seemed to understand.</p>
<p>
And of Rip? He went to his end as uncomprehendingly as he
had sat through the entire deliberation on his title and
existence.</p>
